# SubTaskList: Item Enhancement

## Overview
Design and implement the item enhancement system including gem socketing, item enchanting/upgrading, rerolling mechanics, item fusion, and enhancement failure consequences. This provides players with ways to improve and customize their equipment.

## Dependencies
- Base Item System completed
- Equipment System completed
- Crafting System completed

## Prerequisites
- Gem and rune system designed
- Enhancement mechanics planned
- Failure consequence system defined
