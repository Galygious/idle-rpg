## üìã Milestones & Deliverables

### Milestone 1: Basic Project Structure (Week 1)
- [ ] Frontend and backend projects initialized
- [ ] Basic build system working
- [ ] Version control configured
- [ ] Development environment functional

### Milestone 2: CI/CD Pipeline (Week 2)
- [ ] Automated testing pipeline
- [ ] Code quality checks automated
- [ ] Staging deployment working
- [ ] Documentation site deployed

### Milestone 3: Production Ready Setup (Week 3)

## üîÑ Parallelizable Tasks

### Can Run in Parallel:
- Frontend framework setup + Backend framework setup
- Build tools configuration + Version control setup
- Documentation setup + CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Security configuration + Code quality tools

### Sequential Dependencies:
- CI/CD pipeline depends on build system completion
- Documentation depends on project structure
- Security configuration depends on basic setup

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] Developer can clone repo and run project with single command
- [ ] All code quality checks pass automatically
- [ ] Staging environment deploys on every merge
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities are caught automatically
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are established

## üìù Notes

### Technology Choices Considerations:
- **Frontend**: React for component ecosystem, TypeScript for type safety
- **Backend**: Express.js for simplicity, Fastify for performance
- **Build**: Vite for fast development, Webpack for production optimization
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Cypress for E2E
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for integration with GitHub

### Future Considerations:
- Set up for easy migration to microservices
- Plan for mobile app development
- Consider internationalization from start
- Plan for analytics and monitoring integration
